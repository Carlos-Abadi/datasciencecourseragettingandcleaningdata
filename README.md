# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Week-4-Assignment
This project includes four files: README.md, codebook.md, run_analysis.R, tidy_data.txt

The following steps are performed:

1) Download the dataset to my working directory and unzip.

2) Load the datasets: X_train.txt, X_test.txt, y_train.txt, y_test.txt, subject_train.txt, subject_test.txt, features.txt, activity_labels.txt.

3) Merge  X_train and X_test.txt.

4) Merge  y_train and y_test.txt.

5) Merge subject_train and subject_test.

6) Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

7) Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

8) Appropriately label the data sets with descriptive variable names.

9) Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
